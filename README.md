# For-Anyone-Who-Walks-Revamp
a revamp of iamevn's 3ds app: for-anyone-who-walks-a-lot 

### What do i mean "revamp"?
well, i downloaded the app and while it works it was a bit when displaying text as it was adding coins.

i thought it odd and decided to download the source code and fix up formatting on just 2 lines in the code.
i needed to fix more than 2 lines.

had to upgrade some stuff since it was written so long ago that type names and structs were changed in that time.

i made a new image for the app since i couldnt find the source for the old one, as well as fixing the description and stuff.

### It says it was developed by 'iamevn + r4t'. Wdym?
well, most of the code is theirs and whilst i did update it i dont want to take credit for all of it.
so i decided to leave their name in.

and in spirit to their original project, this too has the "do whatever" license
